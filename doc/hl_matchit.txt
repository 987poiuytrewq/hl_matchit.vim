BACKGROUND					*hl_matchit-background*

I always used matchit.vim. It's quite cool plugin.
When I use it, I noticed I wanna highlight match.
Therefore, I googled by words [vim matchit highlight].
Then, I noticed that many people had same problem,
and I also found this article as follows.
http://objectmix.com/editors/377087-matchit-plugin-highlighting.html

This article resolved my problem because there is .vimrc snippet.
But it's just snippet, I thougt I wanna use as vim plugin.

So, I improved a little that snippet and created this vim plugin.

AS LICENSE:
 I copied and improved from
 http://objectmix.com/editors/377087-matchit-plugin-highlighting.html#post1403424
 there are copyright on the page of bottom
 but I think this snippet's author is Antony.
 I have no method to contanct Antony,
  so I decided to use unlicense.
 I have to say, Thanks Antony!
